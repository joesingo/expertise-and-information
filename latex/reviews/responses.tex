\maketitle

Dear editor and reviewers,\\

We thank you for your detailed comments and suggestions for improving the
paper. The typos, minor points on presentation and bibliographic errors raised
by both reviewers have been fixed in the revised paper. Please find more
detailed responses to each reviewer below.

\todo{General intro responses?}

\begin{comment}
    In order to fully understand the intuitive idea of ``soundness'', I had to
    go to Singleton (2021). The way it’s phrased here, one would think that
    everything which entails a proposition about which the source is an expert
    would be sound. Of course, this would mean that reporting a contradiction
    like $p \land \neg p$ would be vacuously sound, which we see is not the
    case when the semantics is introduced.

\begin{comment}
    I know what this sentence is driving at, but I don’t quite agree with it on
    an intuitive level. Say $A$ has a PhD on how the weather affects mental
    health (but she's not an expert on mental health broadly speaking), and $B$
    is a weatherman; between the two of them they do not make an expert on
    mental health, unless $A$ was an expert already.  I guess there is a subtle
    but important distinction between being an expert on the assertion ``$\phi$
    implies $\psi$’ and being an expert on the way in which $\phi$ affects
    $\psi$.

\begin{comment}
    Page 13: In 1-agent S5 models one can assume without loss of generality
    that the ``knowledge'' modality is universal, for the equivalence class
    partitions the model into the generated submodels given by the equivalence
    classes, each of them with a universal relation. Of course, if we attempt
    to do this in this framework we obtain that the $\A$ and the
    $\K$ modality have the same semantics; I would have loved to see
    some discussion on why this does not work in the present framework.
\end{comment}

\begin{response}
    The difference here is that we work with the language $\mathcal{L}_{\K\A}$,
    which includes not just the knowledge modality $\K$ but also the universal
    modality $\A$. Since in the relational semantics over this language
    $\A\phi$ is always interpreted with the universal relation $X \times X$,
    the notation of a generated submodel trivialises: the whole space $X$
    itself is the only set closed under the universal relation. For this
    reason, the submodels corresponding to the equivalence classes do not
    preserve the truth value of modal formulas, as would usually be the case
    with just the $\K$ modality, and thus the assumption that knowledge is
    universal is \emph{not} without loss of generality.
\end{response}

\begin{comment}
   Page 15: if I’m not mistaken, Corollary 1 follows not from the immediately
   previous Lemma 8 but from Lemma 7 plus the (EA) axiom: if $\E\phi \in
   \Sigma$ then (by (EA)) $\A\E\phi \in \Sigma$ which implies (by the
   definition of $R$) $\E\phi \in \Gamma$.
\end{comment}

\begin{response}
   This is absolutely correct for the second part of Corollary 1. One can also
   show the first part ($\A\phi \in \Gamma$ iff $\A\phi \in \Delta$) without
   Lemma 8 by additionally showing that $\mathbf{4}$ ($\A\phi \rightarrow
   \A\A\phi$) is provable in $\mathbf{KT5}$. While this derivation is fairly
   short, we do need Lemma 8 elsewhere in the paper (e.g. in the truth lemma,
   Lemma 9). For this reason (and to save limited space), we have kept
   Corollary 1 \emph{after} Lemma 8.

\begin{comment}
    Page 21: since the $P_j$'s in this section are Alevandrov topologies, it
    would be nice to bring up the notion of topological join when defining
    $P^\mathsf{dist}_J$.
\end{comment}

\begin{response}
    This is a good point, and we have added a paragraph to point out this
    connection after the introduction of $P^\mathsf{dist}_J$.

\section*{Reviewer 2}

\todo{Journal extension of Singleton (2021)? What can we say here?}

\todo{Title change?}

\begin{comment}
    My third worry is whether there is any inconsistency between the logical
    designs and the example used in Abstract, which states that ``if a source
    has expertise on $\phi$ but not $\psi$, when the conjunction $\phi \land
    \psi$ is sound whenever $\phi$ holds, since we can ignore $\psi$ (on which
    the source has no expertise)''. It looks that the example in Abstract aims
    to argue that the principle ``$\E\phi \land \neg\E\psi \land \phi
    \rightarrow \S(\phi \land \psi)$'' is valid, but it is not hard to
    construct a counterexample to it. This makes me doubt whether or not the
    logical design developed in the paper really captures the example in its
    motivation. Definitely, it may become valid if we restrict the class of
    models, but what the desired conditions should be?
\end{comment}

\begin{response}
    This is a good point, and indeed the principle extrapolated from the
    abstract is not in general valid. As suggested, there are some further
    restrictions upon which it becomes valid, e.g. if one additionally assumes
    expertise is closed under (finite) intersections, that the source does not
    have expertise on any non-empty set strictly stronger than $\phi$ (in the
    sense that $\emptyset \subset A \subseteq \|\phi\|$ implies $A = \|\phi\|$
    for all $A \in P$) and that $\phi \land \psi$ is consistent. This is the
    case in Example 2, for instance.

    Since these additional assumptions are not suitable to introduce the
    intuitive concept of soundness before the semantics are defined, we have
    removed the example from the abstract, replacing it with the following:

    \begin{quotation}
        Closely connected with expertise is a notion of \emph{soundness of
        information}: $\phi$ is said to be ``sound" if it is true \emph{up to
        lack of expertise} of the source. \textbf{That is, any statement
        logically weaker than $\phi$ on which the source has expertise must in
        fact be true. This is relevant for modelling situations in which
        sources make claims beyond their domain of expertise.}
    \end{quotation}

    We have also reworked the same example in the introduction:

    \begin{quotation}
        This formalises the idea of ``filtering out" parts of a statement
        within a source's expertise. For example, suppose $\phi = p \land q$,
        and the source has expertise on $p$ but not $q$. Supposing $p$ is true
        but $q$ is false, $\phi$ is false. However, if we discard information
        by ignoring $q$ (on which the source has no expertise), we obtain the
        weaker formula $p$, on which the source \emph{does} have expertise, and
        which is true. \textbf{If this holds for all possible ways to weaken $p
        \land q$ (this is the case, for instance, if the source does not have
        expertise on any statement strictly stronger than $p$), then $p \land
        q$ is \emph{false} but \emph{sound} for the source to report.}
    \end{quotation}

    We believe the revised versions better match the logical framework which we
    go on to introduce.

    \todo{Shall we point out that their proposed counterexample is not actually
    a counterexample?}
